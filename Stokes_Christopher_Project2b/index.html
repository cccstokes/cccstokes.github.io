        <h2>Cool.</h2>
            <p>I'm ususally taking it easy or at least i try to. My music reflects alot of my feelings and how I see things. My newest song <em>'High'</em> reflects alot of how my journey been since graduating high school. PRETTY CØØL I must say, Life's been pretty lovely for me as the song projects. I have alot of unreleased songs that's not as uplifting but, expressive and i think that's what makes me unique. <strong>I'm not scared to speak on NOTHING</strong>. I'm pretty passionate with everything i do, so i guess you can say i wear my heart on my sleeve. Some people see it as a weakness but if i was faking it, I wouldnt know how to create it honestly. Doing the things I love, is what helps keep a cool head. Whether that be, hydrating myself or stuffing my face, making music, socializing, playing basketball, or etc.</p>

            <h2>Calm.</h2>
              <p>
                  Honestly, I dont know how I remain calm sometimes. I think it's because not much surpirses me anymore. My dad never taught me how to play chess but he taught the lessons of the game. That's kind of how i approach life. Not much surpirses me anymore, in fact I'm learning how to laugh still. I dont like putting my energy into things I can't control. Reason being, if you're playing into a situation of things you cant control, you're playing someone elses game or you're just being handicapped and i hate feeling limited of my capabilites. Unless something is deterimental, or completely out of the ordinary I usually dont go out of my way to help the situation. In the wise words of my legendary little sister, "Let Go & Let God"</p>

            <h2>Collected.</h2>
              <p>
                  I overreact to everything but I try not to but if i do I'm not really worried either. I guess that's how i can seem so sure of things.  Not too much can happen to me that can really throw me off. I've been through trial and tribulation just like everyone else, and i try to keep myself battle tested. Therefore, in a way i hold onto my pain just so i can never experience it again.
